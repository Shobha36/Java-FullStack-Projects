# Java Full Stack Projects 

Welcome to my repository!  
This space showcases the projects I built while learning and applying **Java Full Stack Development**.  
Through this journey, I explored backend, frontend, and database concepts to design, build, and deploy complete applications.

## 📘 Concepts Learned

🔹 **Core Java**: OOPs (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction), Exception Handling, Collections Framework, Multithreading, Garbage Collection  
🔹 **Advanced Java**: Servlets & JSP (Session Management, Request/Response), JDBC (Database connectivity)  
🔹 **Frameworks**: Hibernate (ORM, HQL, Annotations, Entity Relationships), Spring Core (IoC, Dependency Injection), Spring MVC (Controllers, Views, Request Mappings)  
🔹 **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics, JSP for dynamic web pages  
🔹 **Database**: SQL (DDL, DML, Joins, Functions, Aggregates), Advanced SQL (Group By, Rollup, Cube, Subqueries)  
🔹 **Tools & Environment**: Eclipse, Apache Tomcat, MySQL, Git & GitHub

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shobha36/Java-FullStack-Projects.git
2. Import the desired project into Eclipse/IntelliJ as a Maven project

3. Configure the database (update persistence.xml / application.properties with your DB credentials)

4. Run the application as a Java Application or Spring Boot Application

🎯 Learning Outcomes
